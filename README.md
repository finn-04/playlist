playing some unlisted videos that i enjoy . over and over again


these are notes for me .

08.19.2025.01:17 : need to push to fix missing {} in f string for error handling , need to add interrupt handling , need to figure out why it doesn't play after first video . goodnight :wq

09.03.2025.21:53 : still working atm , but for the future maybe have it print the name of the video and not just the link . also work on some of the error messages , cuz lowkey things are working . need to test long enough so that it fully loops , or just make a shorter songs.txt lol

09.04.2025.11:14 : back so soon ? yes . we have titles printing now except it seems as if on subsequent iterations of the loop i'm getting those error messages , even though the videos are playing fine . for future , maybe make this a better user experience -- i.e. instructions or something . maybe how long the program has been running for upon termination . although I AM THE SOLE USER so does this really matter ? could be fun and interesting .
